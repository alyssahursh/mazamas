  volunteer_history: 'For the last five years ski mountaineering has ruled my winter
    life and the last three years I had the honor and pleasure of being the chair
    of this committee. Assisting with basic school and ICS. Supported and actively
    implemented the Avalanche and Crevasse Rescue skillbuilder classes. '
  climb_achievements: 'Ski mountaineering more than 200 trips in the European Alps
    living in Southern Germany. Climbing lesser known peaks in the Cordillera Real
    around La Paz Bolivia, Ski mountaineering expedition to Muztagh Ata on the Pakistan-China
    border. And of course most ice and steep snow chutes on our own Mt. Hood. '
  climb_philosophy: 'Be safe, teach AND learn on each and every climb, have fun. There
    is no ski slope or summit that''s worth risking your life, you want to go on to
    do a lot more other adventures. No matter how rewarding the summit is, the trip
    preparation, the approach and the safe return will make up for a lost summit. '
  summit_treat: Ritter Sport yoghurt, but hey I'm not a fussy eater, surprise me.
  bio: I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands. After working in South America
    and South East Asia I ended up living in southern Germany for 10 years in my wife's
    home area. Here I learned to climb and ski mountaineer. In 1993 I finished my
    training as a ski mountaineering climb leader for the German Alpine Society. We
    have one teenage son in high school. Running and biking has been my method of
    conditioning, but much more than that it serves as stress relieve and meditation.
