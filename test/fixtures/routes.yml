  notes: Acker Rock is a ridge-like formation that towers 3000 feet above the South
    Umpqua and Buckeye Creek valleys in Oregon's southern Cascades. Acker's summit
    is home to the historic Acker Rock Lookout, and is available for rent from June
    23rd through October according to G. Orton's guidebook. The Peregrine Travers
    is Oregon's longest rock route, comprised of 10 pitches, 5.7 with substantial
    exposure.

  glaciated_peak: false

  rappelling: true
  crevasse_rescue: false
  notes: The Aiguille de l'Index is a fine rock summit in the Aiguilles Rouges. While
    there are many routes on this peak by far the most popular, and also one of the
    best, is the Southeast Arete. What makes this route so good is its position and
    views. Facing south, the whole of the Mont Blanc chain rests just over your shoulder,
    and on belays, it is all too easy to get "lost" in the maze of spires and glaciers.
    But the route on the Index is also on a sharp ridge, and the exposure and "airyness"
    of the climb also draw our attention. Finally the summit is a very well-defined
    point and the very steep rappel descent only emphasizes this. This route is of
    moderate difficulty, with rock climbing to about 5.7 (French 5a) at its hardest.
    The crux comes early, on the first pitch, but there are a few moves sprinkled
    here and there for fun. The climb is about 6 or 7 pitches in length, which makes
    it a good choice for a relatively relaxed day on the hill. Because the descent
    is via rappel on the north side of the peak, we need to carry our hiking shoes
    and extra clothing over the top in small day packs.

Route_5:
  id: 5
  name: Arete des Cosmiques
  elevation_gain: '984'
  typical_duration: 1
  glaciated_peak: true
  rock_class: 5
  rappelling: true
  crevasse_rescue: true
  notes: Cosmiques Ridge commences from the Abri Simond hut from where it climbs 150m
    to 3770m. Despite the short distance, the route usually takes about half a day.
    Initially the climbing is up an easy snow slope and then mixed ground. As you
    approach the first gendarme of the subsidiary summit (3731m), climb the inclined
    slabs (4b). Follow the crest of the ridge to the second subsidiary summit. Make
    a descending traverse (exposed, possible abseil) across two steps. Follow the
    steps to the end where it passes between two rock walls. Abseil 30m in two pitches
    via the bolted belays. Continue traversing along terraces to go round the first
    big tower. Climb an awkward chimney (4a) to reach a good ledge on the right. Climb
    back onto the ridge via a snow slope that overlooks the Cosmiques Couloir. Go
    right round a second tower. Alternatively skirt the second tower to the left,
    going through a small notch and descending a small ice couloir. Follow the ridge
    to the foot of the crux slab. The crux slab is only 5m and has an in-situ sling
    and pegs in the diagonal crack running up it but is rated 4c. Above the slab,
    traverse right along the narrow ledge. Climb a few metres to a terrace on the
    left and move onto the NW face. Gain a couloir-chimney, then climb clacks (2 pitches
    3c/4a). Go up onto the final snowy shoulder and climb the metal ladder to the
    terrace on the South pinnacle
